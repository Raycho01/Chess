# Chess Game
This is a chess game implemented as a console application.
You can experience most of the real board game with this simple app (Some more complex rules are not included)
How to play:
1. You need second player sitting next to you.
2. Start the application.
3. Whoever plays with the white figures (the capital letters) goes first.
4. In the console type the word "move" followed by the position of the figure, that you want to move, then add space and the position of the desired destination.

Example: "move a7 a5"
This command moves the top left white pawn two positions forward.
